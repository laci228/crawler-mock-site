# 🕷️ crawler-mock-site

This repository contains a mock website built for testing web crawlers, scrapers, and HTML parsers. It simulates various common structures and patterns found on real-world websites, including product listings, pagination, nested content, and more.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight and customizable environment for:

- Developing and testing web crawlers and scrapers.
- Implementing a fake content-change flow to evaluate scraper adaptability.
- Practicing CSS selector, and parsing strategies.
- Simulating edge cases like broken links, redirects, or missing data.
- Benchmarking and debugging scraper behavior in a controlled setting.
